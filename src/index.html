                <p>
                    One lonely ginger tried to learn french over night, but 
                    he f*ked up and now he speaks only about eggs and cheese.

                            My name is Mandark and I am Dexter's rival. He and
                            I have been competing in science and other things
                            for years and this race is just one more of those
                            things where we try to beat each other, except I try
                            to win by being sneaky and bad!

                <p>
                    In a world where nobody understands him and his brilliant
                    mind. Dexter is the first ginger we ever fell in love with, 
                    he is the original developer of evil deeds.
